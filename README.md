Tested the APIS, with the help of rest-client extension on VSCODE. To do so:
Step 1: under "api-test" folder
      - open "post-reciept.http" file (make sure that the reciept json contents are there) 
      - click on "send request" on top of the url.
      - A new response tab opens up which displays the message or id, copy the id without quotations.
Step 2: under "api-test" folder
      - open "get-points.http" file
      - replace the id, with copied id from the PREVIOUS STEP.
      - click on "send request". Verify the points displayed in the response tab.

Note: 
If there are any issues with the code please do reach out to me at ssiddamr@buffalo.edu, 
I have put in a lot of efforts to learn GoLang and build this assessment. Please do consider me for the oppurtunity. 
Thank you. Happy holidays.
